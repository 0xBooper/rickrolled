# rickrolled
The next world-changing web app that rick rolls you.

# How to use it to annoy your friends:
Give them the link to the hosted app, and tell them you either coded, or found a really neat web game in development.

Then, wait for them to click it. And also wait for their reaction to being rickrolled.

Lastly, enjoy the benefits of being crowned, the guy that rickrolled everyone.

# How it works:
This is a simple app, disguised as a "really cool game".

It renders as a loading page. Then, after a few seconds, it redirects to Never Gonna Give You Up, rickrolling whoever clicked the link.

Also, I could've built it as a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS app, but I didn't, as React's code is obfuscated (kinda), so you can't view-page-source it.

# How I didn't rickroll myself.
While developing it, I changed the `urlToRedirect` from the dreaded rickroll video, to "https://example.com". When I pushed it, I just changed it back.

# Legal stuff?
Never Gonna Give You Up is a song created by Rick Astley, and I do not own any of it.

# Boring definitions:
For those living under a rock, or those older peeps, first, why are you on this repo. Second, rickrolling is tricking someone to watch Never Gonna Give You Up.
